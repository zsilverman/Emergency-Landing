# Mayday

Prints a list of airports and runways that are closest to a given location. The program will list airports that have runways longer than a given minimum length. It will also print the distance from the given location to the airport. In a fictional scenario, a pilot who encounters an emergency situation would use your program to get a list of the nearest landing options. The pilot would enter his/her current location as latitude and longitude (in degrees decimal) as well as the minimum runway length needed to land (in ft).

[Test case: Flying over Sacramento International airport. Position is (38.6954, -121.5910) and you request a minimum landing length of 6000 ft.](https://github.com/zsilverman/Emergency-Landing/blob/master/testmayday1.png)

[Test case: Flying a Space Shuttle, approaching the California coast. Position is (35, -123) and you request a minimum landing length of 15000 ft.](https://github.com/zsilverman/Emergency-Landing/blob/master/testmayday5.png)
